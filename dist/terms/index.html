                <ol>
                    <li>LANGUAGE: All communications made or notices given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in the English language.</li>
                    <li>JURISDICTION, VENUE & CHOICE OF LAW: Through Your use of the Website or Services, You agree that the laws of the
                    State of Nevada shall govern any matter or dispute relating to or arising out of this Agreement, as well as any dispute
                    of any kind that may arise between You and the Company, with the exception of its conflict of law provisions. In case
                    any litigation specifically permitted under this Agreement is initiated, the Parties agree to submit to the personal
                    jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the following county: Washoe County, Nevada. The Parties agree that this
                    choice of law, venue, and jurisdiction provision is not permissive, but rather mandatory in nature. You hereby waive the
                    right to any objection of venue, including assertion of the doctrine of forum non conveniens or similar doctrine.</li>
                    <li>ARBITRATION: In case of a dispute between the Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Parties shall
                    first attempt to resolve the dispute personally and in good faith. If these personal resolution attempts fail, the
                    Parties shall then submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the following
                    county: Washoe County. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, and such arbitrator shall have no
                    authority to add Parties, vary the provisions of this Agreement, award punitive damages, or certify a class. The
                    arbitrator shall be bound by applicable and governing Federal law as well as the law of the following state: Nevada.
                    Each Party shall pay their own costs and fees. Claims necessitating arbitration under this section include, but are not
                    limited to: contract claims, tort claims, claims based on Federal and state law, and claims based on local laws,
                    ordinances, statutes or regulations. Intellectual property claims by the Company will not be subject to arbitration and
                    may, as an exception to this sub-part, be litigated. The Parties, in agreement with this sub-part of this Agreement,
                    waive any rights they may have to a jury trial in regard to arbitral claims.</li>
                    <li>ASSIGNMENT: This Agreement, or the rights granted hereunder, may not be assigned, sold, leased or otherwise
                    transferred in whole or part by You. Should this Agreement, or the rights granted hereunder, by assigned, sold, leased
                    or otherwise transferred by the Company, the rights and liabilities of the Company will bind and inure to any assignees,
                    administrators, successors, and executors.</li>
                    <li>SEVERABILITY: If any part or sub-part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of law or
                    competent arbitrator, the remaining parts and sub-parts will be enforced to the maximum extent possible. In such
                    condition, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force.</li>
                    <li>NO WAIVER: In the event that We fail to enforce any provision of this Agreement, this shall not constitute a waiver
                    of any future enforcement of that provision or of any other provision. Waiver of any part or sub-part of this Agreement
                    will not constitute a waiver of any other part or sub-part.</li>
                    <li>HEADINGS FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY: Headings of parts and sub-parts under this Agreement are for convenience and
                    organization, only. Headings shall not affect the meaning of any provisions of this Agreement.</li>
                    <li>NO AGENCY, PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE: No agency, partnership, or joint venture has been created between the
                    Parties as a result of this Agreement. No Party has any authority to bind the other to third parties.</li>
                    <li>FORCE MAJEURE: The Company is not liable for any failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable control
                    including, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of civil authorities, acts of military authorities, riots, embargoes,
